   REPLer is a small, and basic library for LÖVE that spawns an extra thread,
   and runs a REPL (read-eval-print-loop) in it. This means that you can
   interactively use lua in your console, while running LÖVE, but wait, there's
   more! Even though this runs in a thread, the actual commands are executed on
   the main thread, this means you can modify the game's environment easily.
